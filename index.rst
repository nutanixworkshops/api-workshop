Joan wants to start automating the Nutanix cluster they have running now for a few months. Her organisation has given her the following task to see if she can automate the following parts:

#. Create a storage container
#. Create Networks
#. Upload images
#. Create VMs
#. Manipulate VMs

Reason for some of the API calls is that her organisation is thinking about getting new small clusters, maybe one node solutions, for their remote sites and the Development department.
